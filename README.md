# GPS Multifile Manipulator 
## Introduction

Program for personal use. I had a program that manipulated RINEX files (navigation observations), but it only processed individual files. The problem arose when the manipulation was not 3 but 120. The program finds the navigation files in a given folder and removes any satellites or observations we deemed unnecessary. The program prints the commands of the parent program in the console with the names of files downloaded from the folder.
